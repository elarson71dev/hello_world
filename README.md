Hello there!  My name is Erik Larson, though I call myself "Erik J. Larson" typically, because I write, and there's another and quite famous author named Erik Larson.  So, I distinguish myself from this other guy, in hopes that if I become "famous," no one will be confused as to which famous Erik Larson they are talking about!
